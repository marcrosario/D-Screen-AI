## D-Screen AI: What is it?
We use generative AI to assist, advise, and mitigate social media addiction through a more personalized way.

## Why D-Screen AI?
**Tackles a Common Issue:**
- Social media addiction is a widespread concern affecting people of all ages. This app addresses a significant and growing problem by providing users with tools to manage and reduce their social media usage effectively.

**Personalized Support:**
- The app customizes its reminders and activity suggestions based on the user's specified addiction level and personal interests. This tailored approach increases the relevance and effectiveness of the support provided.

**Regular Interventions:**
- By scheduling reminders and activity suggestions at regular intervals, the app helps users maintain their focus and commitment to reducing social media usage throughout the day. Regular interventions can break habitual patterns and encourage healthier behaviors.

**Holistic Approach:**
- The app encourages a balanced lifestyle by suggesting a variety of activities, including mindful, creative, and physical activities. This holistic approach addresses the mental, emotional, and physical aspects of well-being, promoting overall health.

**Ease of Use:**
- Built with Streamlit, the app offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Users can quickly input their preferences and receive support without any technical difficulties.

**Feedback Mechanism:**
- The app includes a feedback feature where users can indicate whether the reminders and agendas are helpful. This feedback loop can be used to refine and improve the content, making the app more effective over time.

## Our Solution
D-Screen AI is designed to assist users in mitigating their social media addiction by providing motivational reminders and personalized activity agendas. The app leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (or later) to generate supportive content tailored to the user's addiction level and interests.
